# Counter-Strike-1.6-With-Python

o	This project makes it possible to play the famous video game 'CS1.6' just with the hands. Our goal is to pull alone the most important controls in the game to simplify the actions of the fingers and make the result simple and fun.
o Until now, the project is not finished (The player rotation is done by the mouse by another person. In the future, we will assign this task to the left hand such that its movement to the right and to the left makes the player rotate ).
